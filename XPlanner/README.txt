To create and deploy the xPlanner application blueprint, follow the steps in the XPlannerGuide.pdf.

Before starting with the steps in the XPlannerGuide.pdf, download the xplanner-plus.war application war from:

http://xplanner-plus.sourceforge.net/

and host it on a http file server that is accessible in to the deployed VMs.  In the XPlannerGuide.pdf, step 43, replace the war_file URL with the location on the http file server.

The files: configure_webapp.txt, install_db.txt, install_webapp.txt can be opened in a text editor to copy and paste the scripts during the steps in XPlannerGuide.pdf.
